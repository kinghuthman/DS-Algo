// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

// 1. Restate the problem in my own words
//      add two numbers
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//      x, y / string? integer? float?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
//      sum of x, y / integer? float? string?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
//      what happens if someone only passes one integer
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
//      name function 'add', 'num1' and 'num2' as parameters, return 'sum'
